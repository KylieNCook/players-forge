## 2. Implemented Requirements

## 3. Adopted Technologies

Our website is currently simply a minimum viable product made with only HTML and CSS. We plan to implement a database written in Python that holds the mods, games for which those mods are made, user profiles, etc.

## 5. Deployment

## 6. Licensing

**GNU General Public License v3.0**

- [GNU License Overview](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
- [PlayersForge License](https://github.com/KylieNCook/players-forge/tree/main/LICENSE.md)

We chose the GNU General Public License v3.0 so that PlayersForge will be available for others to make improvements and changes to their own copies of the software. The GNU license does not allow making and distributing closed source versions, as we would like our project and separate versions of this project to be open to everyone. 

## 7. Readme File

## 8. Look & Feel

## 9. Lessons Learned
We learned that we can make a nice front-end design for a website using simple knowledge of HTML and CSS. For our next release, we must incorporate some back-end code for our database.

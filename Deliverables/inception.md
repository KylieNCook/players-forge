## 1. Introduction:

Gaming has become a global hobby that brings many people together. From competitive gaming to limitless customization, modern games have
become diverse in content. Likewise, many communities have come together to modify their favorite games. But, such modifications or mods as
they are referred to in the gaming community are at times hard to find. PlayersForge is a service created to facilitate such issues, providing
a hub where players can easily find mods for their favorite games, or upload their own creations. By joining our service, players will
be able to subscribe to their favorite games. Subscribing allows our system to find all the mods relevant to the game. In addition, adding your
favorite mods will let you find similar content, updates, and store them in your library for future use. Users of the service will also be able to link
their social media accounts in order to share and promote their own mods.

## 3. Interviews:

### Interview 1

**Summary:**
Logan stated that he would like a service that is not convoluted by ads, and that he 
would like a service that offers an easy way to install mods. However, such a system should
be more complex than a system like Steam Workshop. A service like PlayersForge must be something
as convenient as Steam but it should also offer a greater level of support to older games.

**Interviewer:** Fernando Diaz\
**Interviewee:** Logan (Loggy) Haga\
**When:** February 6, 2021\
**Consumer Segment:**
Logan is a PC gamer, he plays games such as League of Legends, and Victoria 2.
He is studying education, and wants to bring education to the younger generation.

  - He believes this service would be ideal for older games if it is just as 
	convenient as steam or better. He did say, he plays an 
	older game called Victoria, which does not have many mods given its age.

	mods for their favorite games, especially ones that are not fully supported by Steam.

	user, specially those that are not fully versed in computers.

### Interview 4:
**Summary:** Carson believes that a system such a PlayersForge can be useful, as long as it
features proper communication, such as features that unite players together.

**Consumer Segment:** Carson is a gamer, obsessed with the KFC game: I Love You Colonel Sanders as well as First Person Shooter games such as Rainbow Siege Six, and Call of Duty.\
**Key Insights:**
- According to Carson, it is important to have categories for games. Categories make games easier to find, and also
allow users to find different games in the same category that may appeal to them. A recommendation system can also engage users to find
new games they might like, while also giving them a list of relevant mods. 

**Representative Quotes:**
- "I believe it would be a fun service if it was interactive, such as a live chat. Or just having voice chats for players to engage 
with each other." 
- "Although I understand the name, I believe is a bit too long. The name feels like is just oriented to a single community of 
fantasy users. Almost as if the service was tailored for people who play DnD games, rather than gamers."

- Must have: 
 Easy communication or team chat.\
 Flexibility across different Operating Systems, such as Linux, Windows, or MacOs.

Live chat or voice chat, not a necessity.\
Ability to link projects to different social media and professional platforms.
- Don't care:
Game Billboards.

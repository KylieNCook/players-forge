Group Members: Kylie Cook, Fernando Diaz, David Hermann, Jared McNeece, Conrad Murphy, Noah Olono

## 1. Introduction:
Gaming has become a global hobby that brings many people together. From competitive gaming to limitless customization, modern games have
become diverse in content. Likewise, many communities have come together to modify their favorite games. But, such modifications or mods as
they are referred to in the gaming community are at times hard to find. PlayersForge is a service created to facilitate such issues, providing
a hub where players can easily find mods for their favorite games, or upload their own creations. By joining our service, players will
be able to subscribe to their favorite games. Subscribing allows our system to find all the mods relevant to the game. In addition, adding your
favorite mods will let you find similar content, updates, and store them in your library for future use. Users of the service will also be able to link
their social media accounts in order to share and promote their own mods.

## 3. Interviews:

### Interview 1

**Summary:**
Logan stated that he would like a service that is not convoluted by ads, and that he 
would like a service that offers an easy way to install mods. However, such a system should
be more complex than a system like Steam Workshop. A service like PlayersForge must be something
as convenient as Steam but it should also offer a greater level of support to older games.

**Interviewer:** Fernando Diaz\
**Interviewee:** Logan (Loggy) Haga\
**When:** February 6, 2021\
**Consumer Segment:**
Logan is a PC gamer, he plays games such as League of Legends, and Victoria 2.
He is studying education, and wants to bring education to the younger generation.

**Key Insights:**
  - He believes this service would be ideal for older games if it is just as 
	convenient as steam or better. He did say, he plays an 
	older game called Victoria, which does not have many mods given its age.
  - Having a service that is more centralized can help many people find 
	mods for their favorite games, especially ones that are not fully supported by Steam.
  - Furthermore, Logan stated that such a service has to be easy to use by any
	user, specially those that are not fully versed in computers.

**Representative Quotes:**
  - "The service must be easy and more convenient than Steam."

**Summary:** Carson believes that a system such a PlayersForge can be useful, as long as it
features proper communication, such as features that unite players together.

**Consumer Segment:** Carson is a gamer, obsessed with the KFC game: I Love You Colonel Sanders as
well as First Person Shooter games such as Rainbow Siege Six, and Call of Duty.\

  - It is important to have categories for games. Categories make games easier to find, and also

	new games they might like, while also giving them a list of relevant mods.

  - "I believe it would be a fun service if it was interactive, such as a live chat. Or just having
	voice chats for players to engage with each other." 
  - "Although I understand the name, I believe is a bit too long. The name feels like it is just
	oriented to a single community of fantasy users. Almost as if the service was tailored for
	people who play DnD games, rather than gamers."

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care:**
  - Easy communication or team chat. (Must have)
  - Flexibility across different Operating Systems, such as Linux, Windows, or MacOs. (Must have)

**When:** February 13, 2021\

Group Members: Kylie Cook,

## 1. Introduction:

Gaming has become a global hobby that brings many people together. From competitive gaming to limitless customizability, modern games have
become diverse in content. Likewise, many communities have come together to modify their favorite games. But, such modifications or mods as
they are referred to in the gaming community are at times hard to find. PlayersForge is a service created to facilitate such issues, providing
a hub where players can more easily find mods for their favorite games, or upload their own creations. By joining our service, players will
be able to subscribe to their favorite games. Subscribing allows our system to find all the mods relevant to the game. In addition favoriting your
favorite mods will let you find similar content, updates, and store them in your library for future use. Users of the service will also be able to link
their social media accounts in order to share and promote their own mods.

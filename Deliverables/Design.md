## 1. Description

## 2. Architecture
We designed out system architecture to have four layers: psql & flask, models & forms, app, and serve. Psql & flask consists of packages downloaded for the website to work, configuration, a flask environment file for easy refresh changes, and sqlalchemy to connect with out database models. Then, modles & forms consist of all of our database models and forms, for example: Users database model and RegisterUsers form. Then, the app layers consists of routes for the website, templates (html) and static files (css, images, etc.). Lastly, there is the serve file, which is the system of connecting our github website folder to aws in order to serve the website.
